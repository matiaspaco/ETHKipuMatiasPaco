Hi my name is Matias Paco Viscarra,

I'm a computer technician graduated from Otto Krause High School in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I have been working for a couple of years in the computer science field improving my knowledge as a full stack software developer with .Net . I'm always looking to stay updated with the latest and most disruptive technologies in order to build personal projects in the future and share my knowledge with others.

Iâ€™m especially interested in Web3, as I like the premise of decentralized technology that gives people the opportunity to be part of an ecosystem where not everything belongs to private companies.

I would like to expand my knowledge through personal projects focused on simplifying current processes by applying blockchain traceability, which nowadays are often difficult to access or delayed by bureaucracy.

Regards!
